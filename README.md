## 💼 Projects

Here are some of the projects I’ve completed to apply and demonstrate my cybersecurity skills:

### 📄 [Automating IP Allow List Removal](#)  
*Python-based access control automation*

This project documents the process of developing a Python script (in Jupyter Notebook) to remove no-longer-authorized IPs from a network allow list. It demonstrates skills in:
- Scripting for network security  
- Defensive automation  
- Data manipulation  
- Visual code walkthroughs  

---

### 📁 [File Permissions in Linux](#)  
*Access control in Linux environments*

A hands-on task where I audited and updated file and directory permissions within a Linux projects directory to align with secure access control policies. Skills demonstrated include:
- Linux file system navigation  
- chmod/chown usage  
- Principle of least privilege

### ✅ [Botium Controls Compliance Checklist](#)  
*Security audit and compliance analysis*

This project presents a cybersecurity audit for a fictional company, **Botium Toys**. The initial scenario was provided, but I conducted an independent controls and compliance analysis using:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards  
- Manual gap analysis and risk scoring  

**Key Findings:**
- Missing encryption, backups, and access controls led to a high risk score (8/10).
- Data exposure risks were identified and addressed with specific recommendations.

**Recommendations Included:**
- Least privilege enforcement  
- IDS implementation  
- Password policy improvements  
- Disaster recovery planning
