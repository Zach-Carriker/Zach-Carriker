This section presents my professional statement, outlining my unique background, key cybersecurity certifications, and hands-on technical experience as an ISP Support Technician. It also highlights my current practical application of cybersecurity knowledge and my career aspirations within the field.


Automating_IP_AllowList_Removal.pdf:

This PDF documents the process of developing a Python algorithm within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The algorithm is designed to efficiently remove a specified list of no-longer-authorized IP addresses from an existing network allow list, demonstrating practical skills in access control management, scripting for security automation, and data manipulation for defensive operations. Visual aids illustrate the code execution and its impact.


File_Permissions_in_Linux.pdf

This project addresses the critical task of updating file and directory permissions within a projects directory to ensure proper access control. I was responsible for auditing existing permissions and implementing necessary adjustments to align access levels with security requirements. This work demonstrates my practical skills in managing permissions to enhance system safety and security.


Botium_Controls_Compliance_Checklist.pdf

Project Overview:
This project presents a cybersecurity audit and compliance assessment for Botium Toys, a fictional retail company. The scenario and initial risk assessment report were provided as part of the project materials. Based on that, I independently conducted a controls and compliance analysis and developed actionable security recommendations.

Scope & Objectives:

Evaluate the company's existing controls using industry-standard checklists.

Identify compliance gaps (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC).

Recommend control implementations to reduce risk and strengthen security posture.

Key Findings:

Missing encryption, backups, and secure password management contributed to a high risk score (8/10).

Sensitive customer data was potentially accessible due to lack of access controls.

Strong physical security existed, but technical and procedural security controls needed improvement.

Recommendations:

Enforce least privilege and separation of duties.

Implement encryption, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and a centralized password manager.

Establish disaster recovery plans and data classification procedures.

Tools & Methodologies:

NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Compliance checklists (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 1/2)

Gap analysis and manual risk scoring

Skills Demonstrated:

Cybersecurity auditing

Regulatory compliance evaluation

Technical documentation

Security planning and risk mitigation
