# 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Zachary Carriker**, a newly certified cybersecurity professional with a passion for digital defense and system integrity. With a unique background in customer-focused operational roles, I've leveraged my problem-solving skills and commitment to security as I transition into the cybersecurity domain.

My recent role as an **ISP Support Technician at NRTC** gave me hands-on experience in technical troubleshooting and maintaining secure operations in a real-world setting. I’m actively expanding my skills through labs and challenges on **TryHackMe**, sharpening my practical defense techniques and real-world security awareness.
